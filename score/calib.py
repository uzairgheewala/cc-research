"""Calibration and risk-coverage (D0.4; used by B4).

ECE: claims binned by stated probability into `bins` equal-width bins on [0, 1]; ECE = sum over bins of
(bin share) x |mean stated probability - realised hit rate|. Bins with no claims contribute nothing.
Risk-coverage: claims sorted by confidence (descending, ties together); precision of the most confident share at each
coverage step.
Claimed vs realised: for a selective view that keeps claims whose stated probability is >= p*, the claimed precision is
the mean stated probability of the kept claims and the realised precision is their hit rate (B4.2: realised >= claimed
- 0.03).
