"""DV-1: "if I set T, does Y move?" (D0.4). Same rule as AB-04 (analysis/decision_value_v2.py), restated here.

For every intervention target T and every other variable Y the graph claims
  yes   Y is reachable from T through committed arrows,
  no    Y is not reachable from T even through undecided pairs,
and abstains otherwise. A claim is checked against the true graph's descendants of T.
Pooled over files: coverage = committed claims / (targets x (n - 1)); precision = correct committed / committed.
The empty graph ("nothing moves") claims "no" everywhere; its precision on the same files is the floor a graph must clear.

Selective view (B4): each claim carries a confidence; at cost ratio c/g a "yes" is worth acting on only when
P(correct) > c / (g + c) (AB-04's usefulness threshold). The view keeps claims whose confidence clears a threshold and
reports realised precision at the resulting coverage.
