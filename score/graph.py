"""Graph scores in the scoreboard's units (D0.4).

A predicted graph is (directed, undecided): directed is a set of (cause, effect) index pairs the method commits to;
undecided is a set of unordered pairs (frozenset or 2-tuple) the method found adjacent but left unoriented.
Truth is a set of (cause, effect) pairs.

Expectation rule (the controlled scoreboard's rule, CausalArena Appendix B): every undecided pair is oriented at random
by a generator seeded per file (seed = crc32(file name)), pairs taken in sorted order. This is identical to
analysis/causalarena_io.directed_scores(rule="random"); tests/test_score.py checks the two agree on random graphs.
