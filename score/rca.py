"""AC@k for root-cause analysis (D0.4; used by B5). Same definition as AB-12 (analysis/ab12_rca_probe.py):
a case is a hit at k when its true root cause is among the first k ranked candidates. With abstention, AC@k is
reported on the answered cases together with the answer rate (coverage); an abstained case is not a hit and not a miss.
