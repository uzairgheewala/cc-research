"""The score contract (EVL-01, EVL-02, EVL-03): what every reported score must state.

Every directory under analysis/results/ carries a CONTRACT.json. Score rows written by new code also carry the per-row fields
below (use `row(...)`), and `check_scores.py` rejects any results directory or row that does not state them.

Regime (EVL-01): what information the method was given.
  D       data only (observational rows)
  D+I     data plus interventional rows with their targets
  D+K     data plus knowledge: variable names, declared tiers, an LLM reading names, or oracle order from the true graph
  D+I+K   both
Controls (EVL-02): columns_shuffled (true/false/"per-row"), names ("real", "neutral", "swapped", "synthetic", "per-row"),
  supplier (who produced the data: "causalarena", "repo", "uci", "causal_chambers", "ours"), knowledge_source when K is present.
Metrics (EVL-03): every metric name used must be defined in metric_defs (with the SHD variant and the orientation rule for
  undecided pairs where they apply).
